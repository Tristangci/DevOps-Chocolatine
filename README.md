# DevOps-Chocolatine
Whatever your opinions might be, this is a chocolatine.

But what purpose does it serve? It allows you to go through the day and through your work better. 
In other words, it facilitate your work and allows you to focus on things that matter (discussing its name does not
pertain to this category).

Your repositories are hosted on GitHub, and GitHub has an intuitive way of automating the launch of predefined actions, triggered by events of your choice.
It is, in the same way as chocolatines, a great way to facilitate and enhance your development and your workflow.
In this project, you will setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good practices and diverse rules in a repository.
